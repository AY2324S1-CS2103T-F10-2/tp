## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/lovebook/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/lovebook/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/lovebook/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/lovebook/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/LoveBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Date` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/lovebook/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `LoveBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a date).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `LoveBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `LoveBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/lovebook/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the LoveBook data i.e., all `Date` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Date` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Date>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `LoveBook`, which `Date` references. This allows `LoveBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Date` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/lovebook/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both LoveBook data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `LoveBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Preferences component

The `Preferences` component,
- can save the user's preferences in the dates they are looking for (gender, height, income, age).
- stores these entries collected in a `Preferences.json` file.
- can be changed using the `setP` command (also called `setPreferences` command).
- It extends the `Storage` component and inherits from `LoveBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage` and `DatePrefStorage`.
- It is show on typing on command `showP`.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.LoveBook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**
This section aims to describe the implementation details of the features in LoveBook.

There are 5 main features in that you came up with for LoveBook. 
1. Set preferences
2. Get most compatible match
3. Get random date
4. Filter dates
5. Sort dates
6. Get best match
7. Star dates
8. Unstar dates

### Filter dates

The filter feature is implemented using the `FilterCommand` class. The `FilterCommand` class takes in a `Predicate`
object as a parameter. The `Predicate` object is used to filter the `Date` objects in the `Model` component.
The `FilterCommand` class then returns a `CommandResult` object that contains the filtered `Date` objects.

The _Acitvity_ diagram summarises what happens after the user enters a filter command.

![Filter Activity.png](..%2F..%2F..%2FFilter%20Activity.png)

The _Sequence_ Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues 
the command `filter name/ John`
![Filter Sequence.png](..%2F..%2F..%2FFilter%20Sequence.png)

### Sort dates
The sort feature is implemented using the `SortCommand` class. The `SortCommand` class takes in a `Comparator`
object as a parameter. The `Comparator` object is used to sort the `Date` objects in the `Model` component.
The `SortCommand` class then returns a `CommandResult` object that contains the sorted `Date` objects.

The _Acitvity_ diagram summarises what happens after the user enters a sort command.
![SortActivity.png](..%2F..%2F..%2FSortActivity.png)

The _Sequence_ Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `sort name/ increasing`
![Sort Sequence.png](..%2F..%2F..%2FSort%20Sequence.png)

### Get random Date
The random date feature is implemented using the 'RandomCommand' class. The 'RandomCommand' class calls a 
getRandomPerson() method from the model class. Within the getRandomPerson method, a 'Predicate' object is created and 
used to filter the 'Date' objects in the 'Model component'. The 'RandomCommand' class then returns a 'CommandResult' 
object that contains the random 'Date' object.

### Get best match
The best match feature is implemented using the `BestMatchCommand` class. The `BestMatchCommand` class iterates
through the list of Dates, and calls `GetScore` to get the score of the date based on height, age, horoscope and 
income. Each metric will be scored upon 10, and when it deviates from the user's preferences, the score is reduced.
The maximum score is 40.

### Star dates
The star feature is implemented using the `StarCommand` class. The `StarCommand` class takes in a an 'Index' 
object as a parameter. The 'Index' object is used to identify the `Date` object in the `Model` component to be
starred. The `StarCommand` class then returns a `CommandResult` object that contains the starred `Date` object

### Unstar dates
The unstar feature is implemented using the `UnstarCommand` class. The `UnstarCommand` class takes in a an 'Index' 
object as a parameter. The 'Index' object is used to identify the `Date` object in the `Model` component to be
unstarred. The `UnstarCommand` class then returns a `CommandResult` object that contains the unstarred `Date` object
