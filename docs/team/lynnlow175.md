### Project: LoveBook

LoveBook, is a dating-focused love book application, revolving around providing users with a convenient and an
enjoyable tool to enhance their dating experiences. Featuring user profile management, date organisation, compatibility
ranking, and customizable filtering options, LoveBook enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of your online dating
journey.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Filter Dates by Date Profile Attributes
    * What it does: Allows users to filter dates by their date profile attributes
    * Justification: This feature is useful because it allows user to find the specific dates with the attributes that the 
    user is looking for.
    * Highlights: This enhancement requires the understanding of the model and the creation of new utility class to wrap
    an array of predicates into one predicate so that the code conforms to the SLAP principle. The new utility class 
    implements the Predicate interface and is used in the model to update filtered dates.

* **New Feature**: Sort Dates by Date Profile Attributes

    * Justification: This feature is useful because it allows user to view the dates in a specific order based on a 
    specific attribute.

    attribute to be sorted in a specific order.

* **New Feature**: Random Date command
    * What it does: Allows users to randomly select a date from the list of dates
    * Justification: This feature is useful because helps to solve the issue of indecisiveness when choosing a date.
    * Highlights: This enhancement requires the understanding of how to obtain the complete list of dates and generating
    a random number to select a date from the list.

* **New Feature**: Welcome message
* What it does: Allows users to see a welcome message when they start the application
* Justification: This feature is useful because it makes users feel welcomed when they start the application and conveys
  the app's purpose.
* Highlights: This enhancement requires the understanding of how the javafx works in order to display the message to the 
  user. It also requires the knowledge of where the initial stage is set in order to display the message when the
  application starts.
