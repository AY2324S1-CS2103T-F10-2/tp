Furthermore, the premise of the star command is that it's to be used on\n    an exceptional few dates.

We also had to update how the application\nwill store Dates and DatePrefs separately. In addition, many previous commands of AB3 had to be refactored or changed,\nand we added several new commands to LoveBook as well. Eventually, we were able to successfully implement both the Date\nand DatePref classes and all their associated commands.\n\nOne challenge we faced was implementing the bestMatch feature. Given the tight timeline of the team project, we decided\nto do a simple implementation of this feature that does not provide user with much flexibility. If given more time, we would like\nto develop this further by incorporating the use of artificial intelligence, as it is a relevant feature that will be used in the real\nworld and brings value to our target users.\n\n### Revamping of UI\n\nOur dedication to enhancing the aesthetics of LoveBook is highlighted by our attention to visual representation.\nWe went beyond mere textual displays, incorporating visually engaging elements such as gender icons, horoscope symbols,\nand star command visual cues, all implemented using JavaFX. These features not only contribute to the overall visual\nappeal of the application but also serve a functional purpose in providing users with quick and intuitive insights into\nimportant date attributes. As our team was unfamiliar with JavaFX initially, it took us a great amount of time and\neffort to produce an eventual satisfactory and working UI that we were proud to adopt and incorporate into our application.\n\n[Scroll back to _Table of Contents_](#table-of-contents)\n\n[Scroll back to _Table of Contents_](#table-of-contents)\n\n## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**\n\n1. Improve the command parser to be more robust. Some examples include:\n\n   - Gender entered while adding a new date is case-sensitive. We are planning to make it case-insensitive.\n   - Adding dates with the same name is currently not allowed. We are planning to allow this.\n   - Allowing some fields to be optional if user doesn't have access to the information. For example, if the user does\n     not know the income of the date, he/she can leave it blank. Currently, this is not allowed. We are planning to\n     allow this.\n\n2. Improve the income field to be more robust\n\n   - Currently, the income field is unable to accept a range of values, which might not be inclusive of people who\n     have careers with variable income.\n   - Additionally, right now the income field does not accept a value of 0. This is not inclusive towards students\n     who may not have any income. Hence, we plan to modify the field to accept a value of 0, on top of supporting a\n     range of values\n\n3. Improve issues regarding sorting stability\n\n   - Currently, you are able to sort the dates by a specific field. However, if we sort by income for instance, and two\n     dates have the same value, then when one of those two dates are modified by operations such as star or edit, the\n     order of the two of them can change. The dates are still sorted in order, just that the stability is disrupted. We\n     intend to improve upon our star and edit commands such that they do not disrupt the stability in the future.\n\n4. Improve the filter feature to be more robust. Some examples include:\n\n   - Currently, the filter feature only allows the user to filter by metrics limited to name, age, gender and height.\n     We are planning to allow the user to filter by other metrics such as horoscope and income.\n   - Currently, the filter feature only allows the user to filter by a single keyword for a single metric. We are\n     planning to allow the user to filter by multiple keywords.\n\n5. Improve the error message to be more comprehensive\n\n   - Currently, the error message for user that key in multiple invalid keywords only spots the first invalid keyword.\n     We are planning to allow the user to know all the invalid keywords that he/she has keyed in.\n   - Currently, the error message for filter command with duplicate fields only display the invalid field value error. We are\n     planning to allow the user to know that he/she has keyed in duplicate fields.\n\n6. Improve the message displayed when the user tries to perform an operation on an empty list\n\n   - Currently, for some commands like edit and sort, the message displayed is simply based on the validity check of the parameters and it does not tell the user that the\n     list is empty. For instance, when the user sorts an empty list, the message displayed is \"Sorted!\" which is not very helpful. Hence, we are planning to tell the user that the list is empty and that the operation cannot be performed.\n\n7. Improve the presets bar feature to be more comprehensive and clear\n\n   - Currently, the presets bar feature only accommodates for the commands: `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `setP` and `showP`.\n   - In the future, we plan to add more presets buttons for all 16 commands in the application.\n   - Furthermore, even though there's `clear` command, the button \"clear\" removes all text in the command box, making\n     it ambiguous. We plan to change this in a future iteration like a trash can icon.\n\n8. Improve the filter and sort command formats\n\n   - Currently, the filter and sort commands do not have a strict format. For example, if the user enters a filter command\n     with at least one valid metric and valid metric value, the filter command will still be executed successfully. We plan\n     to come up with a stricter filter and sort format in the future to make it more user-friendly.\n\n9. Improve the best match feature to be more flexible\n   - Currently, the best match feature gives equal weightage to all characteristics: `Income`, `Age`, `Height` and `Horoscope`\n   - To better suit the user preferences, we plan to make the weightage customizable, so users can change the weightage for each characteristic\n\n[Scroll back to _Table of Contents_](#table-of-contents)\n")],1)],1),_v(" "),_c('overlay-source',{attrs:{"id":"page-nav","tag-name":"nav","to":"page-nav"}},[_c('div',{staticClass:"nav-component slim-scroll"},[_c('overlay-source',{staticClass:"nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 small no-flex-wrap",attrs:{"id":"mb-page-nav","tag-name":"nav","to":"mb-page-nav"}},[_c('a',{pre:true,attrs:{"class":"nav-link py-1","href":"#lovebook-developer-guide"}},[_v("LoveBook Developer Guide‎")]),_v(" "),_c('nav',{staticClass:"nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 nested no-flex-wrap"},[_c('a',{pre:true,attrs:{"class":"nav-link py-1","href":"#overview"}},[_v("Overview‎")]),_v(" "),_c('a',{pre:true,attrs:{"class":"nav-link py-1","href":"#acknowledgements"}},[_v("Acknowledgements‎")]),_v(" "),_c('a',{pre:true,attrs:{"class":"nav-link py-1","href":"#table-of-contents"}},[_v("Table of Contents‎")]),_v(" "),_c('a',{pre:true,attrs:{"class":"nav-link py-1","href":"#setting-up-getting-started"}},[_v("Setting up, getting started‎")]),_v(" "),_c('a',{pre:true,attrs:{"class":"nav-link py-1","href":"#design"}},[_v("Design‎")]),_v(" "),_c('nav',{staticClass:"nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 nested no-flex-wrap"},[_c('a',{pre:true,attrs:{"class":"nav-link py-1","href":"#architecture"}},[_v("Architecture‎")])])])])],1)]),_v(" "),_c('scroll-top-button')],1),_v(" "),_m(11)])}
